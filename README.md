## Requirements and Demands on this Project
* I have to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. 
* This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
* It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

### My Tasks and Solutions
* I am required to build a quiz with a timer to answer questions and record their score. So I first built an initial interface of the page template on how my page will be layout.
* I am asked to put a starting reminder so I create a section about the quiz rules.
* I was required to set a timer so I create a function that will display the timer and runs it when the quiz starts.
* I was also asked to get the score or record the correct answer of the user and display it after the quiz so I create a function that will count their correct score, turn it to green and display on the counter. I also touched style to mark their wrong answer into red.
