# Brainstorm-Challenge

## Requirements and Demands on this Project
* I have to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. 
* This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
* It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

### My Tasks and Solutions
* I am required to build a quiz with a timer to answer questions and record their score. So I first built an initial interface of the page template on how my page will be layout.
